Title: Finding Unique or Duplicated Rows or Columns for Atomic Matrices
Authors@R: person("Long", "Qu", role=c("aut", "cre"), email="rtistician@gmail.com")
Depends: R (>= 3.4.0)
Enhances: base
Suggests: microbenchmark
Description: An alternative implementation of base::duplicated.matrix(), base:anyDuplicated.matrix() and base::unique.matrix() for matrices of atomic mode, avoiding the time consuming collapse of the matrix into a character vector. An extra grpDuplicated() function is added, which groups duplicated elements together.
